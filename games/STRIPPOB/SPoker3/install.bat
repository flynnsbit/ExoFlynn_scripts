echo *	To make a working copy on a floppy, you must use a High Density
echo *	disk.  For 5-1/4" systems, simply back-up both Strip Poker Three
echo *	disks and run POKER from Disk 1.  For VGA systems there will be no
echo *	disk swapping necessary.  For EGA systems, copy all files ending with
echo *	the extension '.RPD' from disk 1 to disk 2.  Boot the program from
echo *	disk 1 and swap disks when prompted.  No other swaps will be
echo *	necessary after that.
echo *
echo *	For 3-1/2" VGA systems, copy Disks 1 and 3 onto one High Density disk
echo * 	or boot the program from Disk 1 and then insert Disk 3 when prompted.
echo *	For EGA systems, copy Disks 1 and 2 onto one High Density disk or boot
echo *	The program from Disk 1 and then insert Disk 2 when prompted.
